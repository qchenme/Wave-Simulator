## Fourier Series Wave Simulator [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/d924f2b2-6973-4ff9-abc1-4cf16cc8e990/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/fourier-series-simulator/deploys)
Build with [create-react-app](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/), [D3.js](https://d3js.org/), [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) and deployed by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). 

#### But first, Fourier Series is ...
-> an infinite sum of sine and cosine functions with different amplitudes and periods, which is defined by 4 equations that I'm not gonna list here. 

#### Doesn't sound much fun but ...
-> with the sum with amplitudes and periods specified, it then becomes a weird shaped wave, for example, a triangle wave.

#### Maybe it still doesn't make any sense so ...
-> this [simulator](https://fourier-series-simulator.qichen.me/) is for better understanding of how you could add some sine waves up to create weird-shaped waves.
